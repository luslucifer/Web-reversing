# Configuring Your Environment

To get started with reverse engineering (RE) websites, youâ€™ll often need to bypass detection mechanisms that websites use to spot scrapers or automated browsers. One way to tackle this is by using an undetected browser.

In this guide, weâ€™ll configure **[Librewolf](https://librewolf.net/)**â€”a privacy-focused browser thatâ€™s already equipped with useful patchesâ€”and make a few tweaks to make it fully undetectable for scraping tasks.

----------

## Step 1: Installing Librewolf

Head over to [librewolf.net](https://librewolf.net/) and download the version compatible with your operating system. Follow the installation instructions to set it up.

----------

## Step 2: Modifying `about:config`

Once Librewolf is installed, open the browser and type `about:config` into the address bar. Youâ€™ll see a page with advanced configuration settings.

Change the following settings to enhance stealth:

-   **`librewolf.console.logging_disabled`** â†’ `true`  
    _(Disables console logging to prevent detection.)_
-   **`librewolf.debugger.force_detach`** â†’ `true`  
    _(Ensures debugging tools are detached, avoiding detection.)_
-   **`webgl.disabled`** â†’ `false`  
    _(Enables WebGL for rendering compatibility.)_
-   **`privacy.resistFingerprinting`** â†’ `false`  
    _(Disables anti-fingerprinting measures that can raise suspicion.)_
-   **`devtools.toolbox.host`** â†’ `window`  
    _(Changes devtools host to avoid triggering detection flags.)_
-   **`devtools.source-map.client-service.enabled`** â†’ `false`  
    _(Disables source map service to prevent devtools-based checks.)_

----------

## Step 3: Congratulations!

You now have a browser configured to bypass many common detection methods. This setup allows you to navigate websites without arbitrary restrictions.

Happy scraping! ðŸš€
