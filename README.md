# Advanced Scraping Tutorial

Welcome to this guide! Whether youâ€™re a total beginner or someone with experience navigating the web, this tutorial is here to help you dive into advanced scraping techniques. Donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re just starting out! A great place to build your foundation is Blatzar's [scraping tutorial](https://github.com/Blatzar/scraping-tutorial/tree/master). Once youâ€™ve got the basics, youâ€™ll be all set to tackle whatâ€™s in this guide!

While not mandatory, having some familiarity with **JavaScript/TypeScript** can make things a bit easier as you progress.

----------

## What Youâ€™ll Need

Hereâ€™s your checklist to get started:

-   **Node.js** installed on your system.
-   A basic understanding of **cryptography concepts** (just the essentials).
-   **Curiosity and determination** (donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re not a proâ€”persistence is key!).

## What is Obfuscation?

Letâ€™s break down the concept of obfuscation.

**Obfuscation (noun):**  
_"The process of making something confusing or difficult to understand, often on purpose."_

In programming, obfuscation involves making code challenging for humans to read while keeping it functional for machines. Think of it as turning clear instructions into a puzzle.

This technique is widely used to protect code and data, despite criticism from security researchers. Itâ€™s everywhereâ€”from desktop apps to web applications. Unfortunately, it also makes tasks like debugging, privacy analysis, or simply understanding how your device communicates with a website much harder.

But donâ€™t worryâ€”thatâ€™s exactly what weâ€™re here to tackle.
